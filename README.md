# dhSegment

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/dhsegment/badge/?version=latest)](https://dhsegment.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

**About This Fork of dhSegment:**
This variant of dhSegment has been customized for Internet Archive. No attempt has been made to 
make the changes general enough to be folded by back into dhSegment as pull requests 
(except for minor fixes). The file prefix "ia_" is used to identify new files added. These might
be helpful to others, at least for showing what is possible and how we did it.
Files under dh_segment/ and train.py have *not* been changed.

**dhSegment** is a tool for Historical Document Processing. Its generic approach allows to segment regions and
extract content from different type of documents. See 
[some examples here](https://dhsegment.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro/intro.html#use-cases).

The complete description of the system can be found in the corresponding [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10371).

It was created by [Benoit Seguin](https://twitter.com/Seguin_Be) and Sofia Ares Oliveira at DHLAB, EPFL.

## Installation and usage
The [installation procedure](https://dhsegment.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start/install.html) 
and examples of usage can be found in the documentation (see section below).

## Demo
Have a try at the [demo](https://dhsegment.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start/demo.html) to train (optional) and apply dhSegment in page extraction using the `demo.py` script.

## Documentation
The documentation is available on [readthedocs](https://dhsegment.readthedocs.io/).
